# Chessboard Color Change Project

This project is a chessboard simulation where you can change the color of the tiles on a chessboard by clicking on them. The color alternates between various states like black, white, yellow, and red. The project uses **React** for the frontend and **Redux** for state management.

## Features

- **Dynamic Chessboard**: The board is an 8x8 grid where each tile can be interacted with.
- **Color Changing Mechanism**: Each tile has an initial color. When clicked, it toggles between several colors (white, yellow, red, black).
- **State Management**: The state is managed using Redux, with each tile's state stored in the global Redux store.
- **Reusable Components**: The board and individual tiles are reusable components, making it easy to modify or extend the project.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A toolset for efficiently managing application state in React apps.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS or custom styling)**: For styling the components and chessboard layout.
